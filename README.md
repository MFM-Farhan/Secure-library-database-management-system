# Secure Library Database Management System

Database design and implementation project for a secure library management system. Includes ER diagrams, SQL scripts (views, triggers, procedures), and security analysis against SQL Injection and privilege escalation.


This project was developed as part of the **IE2042 - Database Design, Implementation and Security** module at SLIIT. It focuses on designing a secure, efficient, and scalable library database system using relational database principles and implementing essential features using SQL.

## Project Overview

The system models the operations of a library, covering:

- **User roles**: Librarians, Library Assistants, Students, Faculty, and Staff
- **Items**: Books, Journals, and Digital Media
- **Transactions**: Borrowing, Returning, and Reservations
- **Security Features**: Prevention of SQL Injection, use of views, triggers, and privilege management

## Features

- **Entity-Relationship Diagram** and Relational Schema
- **SQL Scripts** for:
  - Table creation
  - Views for data abstraction and access control
  - Triggers for data integrity enforcement
  - Stored Procedures for modular, secure operations
- **Security Analysis**:
  - SQL Injection prevention techniques
  - Privilege escalation mitigation



## ðŸ§  Learning Outcomes

- Applied relational database theory to real-world scenarios
- Implemented complex SQL constructs (views, triggers, procedures)
- Conducted database security assessments and implemented mitigation strategies
